Native space stats by class (bytes):
	sizeof(SuffixTree): 40
	sizeof(TreeNode): 48
	sizeof(Edge): 16
From input string of len 11383, suffix-tree has 11383 leaves, 7300 internal nodes, and 18682 edges.
SuffixTree=40 bytes  TreeNode=48 bytes  Edge=16 bytes
Given the static class size overhead, the current tree consumes a minimum of 1195736 bytes.
Actual size may differ as vector allocator allocates larger data capacity than usage per node.
Space constant (tree size / input size): 105
