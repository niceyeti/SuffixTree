Native space stats by class (bytes):
	sizeof(SuffixTree): 48
	sizeof(TreeNode): 32
	sizeof(Edge): 12
From input string of len 7, suffix-tree has 7 leaves, 4 internal nodes, and 10 edges.
SuffixTree=48 bytes  TreeNode=32 bytes  Edge=12 bytes
Given the static class size overhead, the current tree consumes a minimum of 520 bytes.
Actual size may differ as vector allocator allocates larger data capacity than usage per node.
Space constant (tree size / input size): 74
